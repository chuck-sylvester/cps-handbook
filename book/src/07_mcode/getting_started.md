# Getting Started

### Background
Discovered the mCode / CodeX initiative as part of my work on the VA National Clozapine Registry (NCR) redesign project. The scope of the redesign efforts is broder than the current application (Clozapine Registry), and will include Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation (REMS) drug safety programs.

For the REMS aspect, FDA has partnered with MITRE to build a prototype application that demonstrate REMS capability. This prototype is made up of several components, each of which is managed within GitHub. This project is open source and encourages particpation by non-FDA/MITRE contributors.

So far, I've found it pretty interesting and will attempt to participate as a contributor. As a start, I have forked each of the repositories from the https://github.com/mcode organization.  

The mCode repositories are:

https://github.com/mcode/rems-setup.git
https://github.com/mcode/test-ehr.git
https://github.com/mcode/request-generator.git
https://github.com/mcode/rems-admin.git
https://github.com/mcode/pims.git
https://github.com/mcode/rems-smart-on-fhir.git
```

### Setup Guide
The FDA/MITRE team has created a repository, `rems-setup` that provides comprehensive setup information for contributors who what to set up a simple environment, a Docker-based environment, or a full environment that runs each of the components independently.  My inclination is to go with a Non-Docker full developer setup.
