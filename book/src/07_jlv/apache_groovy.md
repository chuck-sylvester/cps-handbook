Copied folder to /Library

**CPS Note (10/8/22)**
I believe I used `~/swtool` as the location on my BAH MBP.  
So, update all references of `/Library` to `~/swtool` for BAH MBP.

Extracted zip file and copied base folder to ~/swtool/groovy-4.0.3.13

### Validate Groovy Installation

The following information is from [groovy-lang.org/install](https://groovy-lang.org/install.html)

Validate Groovy install by typing the following in a command shell:

```
groovysh
```

Which should create an interactive groovy shell that accepts Groovy statements.

To run the Swing interactive console type:

```
groovyConsole
```

To run a specific Groovy script type:

```
groovy SomeScript
```
