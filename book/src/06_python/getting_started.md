# Getting Started

### Using a shebang line
Python code can begin with a line that starts with a hash (#) and a bang (!). This line is commonly called the _shebang line_. It is ignored by Windows, but it's used by Unix-like operating systems, including macOS, to specify the interpreter for the program.

The example below specifies that a program should be run using Python3.

```bash
#!/user/bin/env python3
```
